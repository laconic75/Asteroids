# Asteroids
## A pyglet port of RiceRocks
This is a pyglet port of the final project for the "Introductions to Interactive Progromming in Python" from Coursera. This code should be pretty easy to follow if you finished the course. There are a few new concepts though. 

* Inheritance
* Properties
* Decorators

I'll try to explain these concepts better later or at least provide a few good links, but untill then it shouldn't be too hard to Google them is you don't understand something in the code.
